# Odin Project - Etch-a-Sketch

## An Overview
Here is my implementation of the etch-a-skecth project from the Odin Project. I actually found this project simpler than aticipated and feel like it was a great way to practice the skills of DOM manipulation I had learnt in the foundations part of the course.

## Issues

The main problems I ran into when creating this project were as follows:
- Still having a few issues with scope and trying to use local variables in other functions.
- Web design certainly isn't my strong point so I opted for something really plain and simple.

## What I learnt/practiced

As I said before I feel that this is such a perfect project to end this part of the course. It has given me an opportunity to practice...

- DOM manipulation via JavaScript.
- Getting values from HTML elements I've not used before like ranges.
- Thinking about variables and the idea of getting away from global variables where possible.
- Googling skills and working with documentation - particular shoutout to MDN and W3 schools!

## Improvements

- I did go for the extra credit of allowing the user to change the color via a HTML5 color input element. But I feel that to take this projecct to the next level, implementing the rainbow color would be a nice extension.
- I would look to refactor some of the JS code.

## Summary
All in all this was a really fun project and I can feel my JavaScript skills improving every time I tackle a problem like this. It was such a  nice feeling finishing this project, particuarly after checking out some of the live examples before starting and just thinking "there's no way I can do that!!".
